# Wine Tasting Visual Vocabulary - Categorical Structure (Olog)
#
# This olog (ontology log) specifies the categorical structure that underlies
# the wine tasting visual vocabulary translation system.
#
# Following David Spivak's methodology: types (objects), aspects (attributes),
# facts (commutative diagrams), and morphisms (structure-preserving maps).

morphisms:
  
  varietal_functor:
    domain: VarietalCharacter
    codomain: VisualVocabulary
    description: "Base morphism mapping grape variety to visual characteristics"
    preserves:
      - identity: "Same varietal always maps to same base characteristics"
      - composition: "Combining varietal attributes preserves structure"
    examples:
      - "Pinot Noir → {translucent, delicate, silky, nuanced}"
      - "Cabernet Sauvignon → {opaque, bold, structured, monumental}"
      - "Riesling → {crystalline, precise, electric, luminous}"
  
  climate_functor:
    domain: TerroirContext
    codomain: VisualVocabulary
    description: "Environmental modifier transforming base characteristics"
    preserves:
      - monotonicity: "Warmer climate → monotonically increases saturation"
      - tension: "Cooler climate → increases visual tension/angularity"
    examples:
      - "Cool → {angular, bright, tense, mineral}"
      - "Warm → {soft, rich, relaxed, sun-drenched}"
  
  oak_functor:
    domain: WinemakingProcess
    codomain: VisualVocabulary
    description: "Process overlay adding texture and material qualities"
    preserves:
      - additivity: "Oak characteristics overlay without destroying base"
      - intensity: "More oak → monotonically increases warmth/richness"
    examples:
      - "None → {pure, transparent, clean}"
      - "French Oak → {silky, refined, vanilla-spice}"
      - "American Oak → {bold, creamy, coconut-caramel}"
  
  time_functor:
    domain: TemporalState
    codomain: VisualVocabulary
    description: "Temporal transformation evolving all parameters"
    preserves:
      - directionality: "Time always moves forward in color evolution"
      - integration: "Older wine → monotonically increases integration"
      - clarity_degradation: "brilliant → bright → clear → dull"
    examples:
      - "Youthful → {vibrant, primary, taut, separate}"
      - "Mature → {tertiary, silky, seamless, luminous}"
      - "Past Prime → {fading, oxidized, thin, dull}"

      - reciprocity: "Balance shifts preserve relative relationships"
    examples:
